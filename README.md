# Exploration of No-show Appointment Data setÂ¶

## Data Set

In this project, I will be analyzing data associated with medical appointments and in particular, I will be interested in finding trends among patients who show up and patients who do not show up for their appointments.

## Insights

1. What is the percentage of patients that show up for their appointments and the patients that do not show up for their appointment?
2. Which gender shows up more for appointment?
3. What is the age group of patients that show up more for appointments?

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- Jupyter notebook
  (Installing Anaconda is an easier route to downloading these packages)

## Libraries

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps

1. Data Wrangling - This is where we'll be inspecting the data to understand the structure and figure out any changes I have to make.

2. Data Cleaning - I will be looking out for incorrect data types, missing data, duplicates, structural problems (such as different column names), inconsistency in writing column names(such as lowercase, uppercase, camelcase, underscores or hypen), mismatch number of records.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis - Here, we explore the data using graphs or through some python functions, then summarize the key insights

4. Visualization

## Summary of Findings

This data analysis was set out to investigate the trends among patients who show up and patients who do not show up for their appointments. The independent variable were Age, AgeGroups and Gender with NoShow being the dependent variable.

The findings from this investigation showed generally that women show up more for their appointments. It showed that 82.6% of women show up more for their appointment.

The investigation found that most patients that show up for appointments are old in the age range of 70-100.
